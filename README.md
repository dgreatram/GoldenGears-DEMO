GoldenGears — DEMO

Golden Gears is a roguelike, top-down, single-player action adventure where you battle powerful isekai’d warriors to collect the four Golden Gears needed to activate a mysterious portal and return home.

Each defeated enemy unlocks their unique abilities, allowing you to play as fallen warriors and experiment with different combat styles in future runs.
